# Days Since Dilled 🚧

*The most important workplace safety metric you never knew you needed.*

## What is this?

A beautifully designed counter that tracks the most critical workplace safety statistic: **Days since Dill-Stain has cucked a pull**. 

Because let's face it, we all need to know when it's safe to merge code again. 🎯

## Features

- ✨ **Glassmorphism design** - Because safety should look good
- 🎨 **Animated counter** - Pulsing with the rhythm of workplace chaos
- 📱 **Mobile responsive** - Check your safety status on the go
- 🚧 **Construction-themed** - Stay safe out there!

## The Science

This counter operates on the principle that workplace safety is directly correlated with the number of days since the last "incident." The longer the streak, the safer the workplace. It's science. 🔬

## Deployment

Just push to GitHub and enable Pages. The counter will automatically track your team's safety record. No configuration needed - it's that simple.
